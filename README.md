# Face Fodder
Face Fodder is a brand and informative website for users looking to learn about natural food ingredients which can be used for skincare maintenance.
The website also houses DIY tutorials which users can follow like a recipe to make their own homemade skincare products, such as moisturising facemasks.

The word '_fodder_' is a slang term in the north of England for food, hence the name Face Fodder is a play on 'face food'.

Face Fodder is a brand and blog I created a few years ago but using a drag and drop website builder tool. In this project I will give the informative website a layout refresh to make
it more user intuitive, to deliver better UX and UI to a user. This time I will also be building the website from scratch using HTML and CSS.

## User Experience (UX) Requirements

Face Fodder combines her love of superfoods with the goodness it delivers to her skin through the natural vitamins and mineral found in food she eats. She sees the Face Fodder

## Design

### Website Navigation and Layout
The website navigation will be layed out as depicted below:

![alt text](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/master/wireframes/00.%20Face%20Fodde%20Site%20Map.png "Face Fodder Site Map")

The flow of navigation follows a very similar flow to a culinery recipe cookbook, where you would have detailed information about individual ingredients and then the recipes themselves.

This recogniable flow of navigation will hopefully prove intuitive to the user. 

### Wireframes

All wireframes are located in the [wireframes folder](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/796fb54fe388c0af462a393817acdecd329a6ea6/wireframes).
