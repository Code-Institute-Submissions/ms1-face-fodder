# Face Fodder
Face Fodder is a brand and informative website for users looking to learn about natural food ingredients which can be used for skincare maintenance.
The website also houses DIY tutorials which users can follow like a recipe to make their own homemade skincare products, such as moisturising facemasks.

The word '_fodder_' is a slang term in the north of England for food, hence the name Face Fodder is a play on 'face food'.

Face Fodder is a brand and blog I created a few years ago but using a drag and drop website builder tool. In this project I will give the informative website a layout refresh to make
it more user intuitive, to deliver better UX and UI to a user. This time I will also be building the website from scratch using HTML and CSS.
