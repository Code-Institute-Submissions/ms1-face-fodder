Face Fodder is a brand and informative website for users looking to learn about natural food ingredients which can be used for skincare maintenance.
The website also houses DIY tutorials which users can follow like a recipe to make their own homemade skincare products, such as moisturising facemasks.

The word '_fodder_' is a slang term in the north of England for food, hence the name Face Fodder is a play on 'face food'.

Face Fodder is a brand and blog I created a few years ago but using a drag and drop website builder tool. In this project I will give the informative website a layout refresh to make
it more user intuitive, to deliver better UX and UI to a user. This time I will also be building the website from scratch using HTML and CSS.

Face Fodder combines her love of superfoods with the goodness it delivers to her skin through the natural vitamins and mineral found in food she eats. She sees the Face Fodder

## Design

### Website Navigation and Layout
The website navigation will be laid out as depicted below:

![alt text](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/master/wireframes/00.%20Face%20Fodde%20Site%20Map.png "Face Fodder Site Map")

The flow of navigation follows a very similar flow to a culinary recipe cookbook, where you would have detailed information about individual ingredients and then the recipes themselves.

This recognisable flow of navigation will hopefully prove intuitive to the user. 

### Wireframes

All wireframes are located in the [wireframes folder](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/796fb54fe388c0af462a393817acdecd329a6ea6/wireframes).

Inside the folder are wireframes for:
* desktop view
  - [Home Page](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/796fb54fe388c0af462a393817acdecd329a6ea6/wireframes/A1.%20Home%20Page%20-%20Desktop.png)

### Logo and Slogan
Using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) I designed a logo for Face Fodder with the slogan "_delicious food for your face_". The slogan is to help a user understand almost straight away what the website has been designed for and what kind of information a user may find when browsing this website.

The logo is an icon of a woman's face with a beauty treatment face mask applied to her face, and a towel on her head that has been made to look like a carrot/ food item. 

![alt text](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/master/assets/img/facefodderlogo.png "Face Fodder Logo")

### Colour Palette and Fonts

The fonts I have selected are:
```CSS
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    font-family: 'Crushed', cursive;
}

p {
    font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;
}

header {
    font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 500;
}
```
The font Crushed is used in the sub text/ slogan in the Face Fodder logo. Raleway was a [popular font paring suggested by google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crushed?query=crushed&sidebar.open=true&selection.family=Crushed#pairings).

The colour palette I chose for the website is:

![alt text](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/854842a94339ff74f715aafe597c4d4feb25964c/assets/img/face-fodder-colour-palette.png "Face Fodder Colour Palette")

The colours chosen are to give a natural, organic and soft feel to the website. #212529 has been chosen for text, to given a strong contrast between the white background and dark text, this is to meet with accessibility guidelines.

All buttons will have a background colour of #63c29c.

## Features

### Desktop Menu
I have created a naviagtion menu that follows the [site map](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/master/wireframes/00.%20Face%20Fodde%20Site%20Map.png) of the website. On level 1 of the menu, on hover the text colour intensifies. On dropdown level 2 and 3 of the menu, the text background is highlighted grey. Both of these menu features have been added so that a user can easily follow their selection. The menu has been made '_sticky_' using the boostrap class `sticky-top`, this is to ensure the menu is static when a user scrolls a page.

On each page I have also used a hero image of natural ingredients to add an elegant and organic feel to the UI.

![alt text](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/master/features/desktop-menu.PNG "Face Fodder Desktop Menu")

### Responsive Burger Menu

I have used a burger menu for small screen devices. Each page of the website has been optimised to small screen devices, using media queries `@media (max-width: 576px)` and `@media (max-width: 767px)` to reduce 3 or 2 columns into 1 column on a small screen.

![alt text](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/master/features/responsive-design.PNG "Responsive Burger menu design")

### Home Page Feature Recipes

On the home page, I have address user story 2:
> User story 2 - _"My skin is really dry, I wonder what could help with the dryness?"_

![alt text](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/master/features/quick-nav-to-face-mask-recipes.PNG "Home page quick feature links to face mask recipes")

When a user lands on the home page they can quickly naviagtion to a skin care solution via these home page feature images.

### Carousel

I have created two carousels through the website, one for featured ingredients, and a second for featured face mask recipes on rotation. These are automated to showcase featured ingredients and recipes, they also have a button if a user desires extra information.

![alt text](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/master/features/carousel.PNG "Ingredients Carousel")

![alt text](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/master/features/carouselv2.PNG "Recipe Carousel")

### Contact Form

A website contact form has been build to address user story 4:

> User story 4 - _"I've tried a few recipes on the Face Fodder website and love them, but I have a question I need to ask?"_

![alt text](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/master/features/contact-form.PNG "Contact form")

### Contact Form Validation

The name and email address fields have been set as `required` fields. Using the JS validation event handler script form the [boostrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/forms/#validation):

```Javascript
<script>
    // Example starter JavaScript for disabling form submissions if there are invalid fields
    (function() {
    'use strict';
    window.addEventListener('load', function() {
        // Fetch all the forms we want to apply custom Bootstrap validation styles to
        var forms = document.getElementsByClassName('needs-validation');
        // Loop over them and prevent submission
        var validation = Array.prototype.filter.call(forms, function(form) {
        form.addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
            if (form.checkValidity() === false) {
            event.preventDefault();
            event.stopPropagation();
            }
            form.classList.add('was-validated');
        }, false);
        });
    }, false);
    })();
    </script>
```
with boostrap classes `needs-validation` and `invalid-feedback`, I was able to display valid and invalid fields with more helpful feedback and icons, as depicted in the below screenshot:

![alt text](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/master/features/contact-form-validation.PNG "Contact form UI validation alerts")

### Footer

In the footer I have placed social media icons with links to the external social platforms, the links all open in a new tab/ window. An email address is also available if a user prefers to contact via email as opposed to the contact form available.

![alt text](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/75a74d8f6cf0536d203c87d5289acacee23a4839/features/footer.PNG "Face Fodder footer with social icon links")
