# Face Fodder
Face Fodder is a brand and informative website for users looking to learn about natural food ingredients which can be used for skincare maintenance.
The website also houses DIY tutorials which users can follow like a recipe to make their own homemade skincare products, such as moisturising facemasks.

The word '_fodder_' is a slang term in the north of England for food, hence the name Face Fodder is a play on 'face food'.

Face Fodder is a brand and blog I created a few years ago but using a drag and drop website builder tool. In this project I will give the informative website a layout refresh to make
it more user intuitive, to deliver better UX and UI to a user. This time I will also be building the website from scratch using HTML and CSS.

---------------------------------------------------------
## User Experience (UX) Requirements

### Target User
A millennial woman who loves to pamper herself with luxury skincare but who would also like to experiment with using more natural ingredients in her daily skincare regime.
She is looking to explore new and easy ways to make her own homemade skincare remedies which will deliver her the same results and experience. She loves eating healthy super foods.
Face Fodder combines her love of superfoods with the goodness it delivers to her skin through the natural vitamins and mineral found in food she eats. She sees the Face Fodder
skincare recipes as a more natural and delicious way of nourishing her skin, and also enjoys learning about how the foods she eats can benefit her skin.

## Design

### Website Navigation and Layout
The website navigation will be laid out as depicted below:

![alt text](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/master/wireframes/00.%20Face%20Fodde%20Site%20Map.png "Face Fodder Site Map")

The flow of navigation follows a very similar flow to a culinary recipe cookbook, where you would have detailed information about individual ingredients and then the recipes themselves.

This recognisable flow of navigation will hopefully prove intuitive to the user. 

### Wireframes

All wireframes are located in the [wireframes folder](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/796fb54fe388c0af462a393817acdecd329a6ea6/wireframes).

Inside the folder are wireframes for:

### Logo and Slogan
Using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) I designed a logo for Face Fodder with the slogan "_delicious food for your face_". The slogan is to help a user understand almost straight away what the website has been designed for and what kind of information a user may find when browsing this website.

The logo is an icon of a woman's face with a beauty treatment face mask applied to her face, and a towel on her head that has been made to look like a carrot/ food item.

### Colour Palette & Fonts

The fonts I have selected are:
```CSS
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    font-family: 'Crushed', cursive;
}

p {
    font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;
}

header {
    font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 500;
}
```
The font Crushed is used in the sub text/ slogan in the Face Fodder logo. Raleway was a [popular font paring suggested by google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crushed?query=crushed&sidebar.open=true&selection.family=Crushed#pairings).

The colour palette I chose for the website is:

![alt text](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/854842a94339ff74f715aafe597c4d4feb25964c/assets/img/face-fodder-colour-palette.png "Face Fodder Colour Palette")

The colours chosen are to give a natural, organic and soft feel to the website. #212529 has been chosen for text, to given a strong contrast between the white background and dark text, this is to meet with accessibility guidelines.

### Features

#### Desktop Menu
I have created a naviagtion menu that follows the [site map](https://github.com/caseybanks/ms1-face-fodder/blob/master/wireframes/00.%20Face%20Fodde%20Site%20Map.png) of the website. On level 1 of the menu, on hover the text colour intensifies. On dropdown level 2 and 3 of the menu, the text background is highlighted grey. Both of these menu features have been added so that a user can easily follow their selection.

On each page I have also used a hero image of nature ingredients to add an elegant and organic feel to the UI.

#### Responsive Burger Menu

I have used a burger menu for small screen devices. Each page of the website has been optimised to small screen devices, using media queries `@media (max-width: 576px)` and `@media (max-width: 767px)` to reduce 3 or 2 columns into 1 column on a small screen.
